# Deepfake Detection using Deep Learning & Computer Vision

This project implements an AI-based Deepfake Detection system that identifies whether an image/video frame is real or fake. It combines YOLO-based face detection with a CNN classifier trained using TensorFlow/Keras to perform accurate deepfake classification.

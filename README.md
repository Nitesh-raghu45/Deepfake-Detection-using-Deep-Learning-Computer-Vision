# Deepfake Detection using EfficientNetB4 (TensorFlow)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting deepfake images/videos using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNetB4 implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to distinguish between real and fake faces by learning subtle visual artifacts introduced during deepfake generation.
